# BreastScanNN-Deep-Learning-for-Cancer-Classification

This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant using clinical features. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras, the model processes real-world breast cancer data, offering predictive insights that can support early detection and diagnosis.

üîç Key Project Components

Dataset: Breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets (also available in Kaggle), containing 30 numerical features related to tumor measurements.

Data Preprocessing:

1) Data cleaning and structure validation

2) Target labeling and distribution analysis

3) Standardization using StandardScaler

Model Architecture:

1) Implemented using Keras Sequential API

2) Includes a flattening layer, a hidden dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final output layer with sigmoid activation

Training & Evaluation:

1) Trained on an 80/20 train-test split

2) Evaluated using accuracy, loss curves, and prediction results

Visualization:

1) Explored feature distributions and target balance

2) Suggestions for future implementation: include ROC curves, confusion matrices, and model interpretability tools like SHAP

üí° Why This Project Stands Out

1) Demonstrates hands-on use of neural networks on structured medical data‚Äîa valuable application of deep learning outside of image-based datasets.

2) Cleanly structured and highly readable for educational or real-world use.

3) Excellent starting point for deploying AI in clinical decision support systems.

üöÄ Future Enhancements

1) Integrate cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for improved generalization.

2) Deploy the model as a web API for real-time predictions.

3) Extend analysis with model explainability techniques like SHAP or LIME.

4) Train on a broader dataset to support generalization to diverse populations.
